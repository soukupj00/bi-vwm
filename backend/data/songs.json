But to the degree that you resist the stream,\nThen you notice that the current is rushing past you and fighting you.\nSo swim with it. Go with it. And you're there. You're at rest.\"\nIt'll wear you down, through skin and bone, through skin and bone\nIt's as if my mind has a mind of it's own, has a mind of its own.\nIt'll wear you down, through skin and bone, through skin and bone\nIt's as if my mind has a mind of it's own, has a mind of its own.\nWhen my heart skips two beats, I am hidden deep, Fast asleep.\nThe sea will part, where the oceans meet. Finally complete.\nIt's a promise that you cannot break.\nIt's a promise that you cannot break.\nWas your life worth dying for?\nThe universe survives on give and take.\nDeath is an open door.\nIt's a promise that you cannot break.\nWas your life worth dying for?\nThe universe survives on give and take.\nDecay is the only law.\nSwan song.\nA declaration of endlessness.\nI swear I will not look back,\nAs I return into the black.\nWhen the veil lifts, how will I know?\nWill I see God?\nAs above, so below.\nDismantled piece by piece,\nWhat's left will not decease.\nAs within, so without.\nThe seasons bring relief.\nJust let me live and die in peace.\n\"You can't hang onto yourself. You don't have to try not to hang onto yourself.\nIt can't be done, and that is salvation.\nMemento Mori; be mindful of death.\"\n"

What I need \nHappiness is an emotion I was born to this world without, nothing pleases me.\nAnd I can never be satiated.\nThrough this toil I will breed my own distress and destroy my best hopes,\nFuck up the only things that I love.\nI watched my aspirations crashing to the ground, on the backs of the angels that I've slain.\nBut I meant so well, I tried so hard, gave everything in my soul, to what end, to what end\nDesolation, desire, exhale, pass away. \n"

It was said, \"They shall not pass!\"\nThe spirit of resistance and the madness of the war\nSo go ahead!\nFace the lead!\nJoin the dead!\nThough you die!\nWhere you lie!\nNever asking why!\nDescend into darkness\n303 days below the sun\nFields of Verdun\nAnd the battle has begun\nNowhere to run\nFather and son\nFall one by one\nUnder the gun\nThy will be done\nAnd the judgement has begun\nNowhere to run\nFather and son\nFall one by one\nFields of Verdun\n"

Hellas!\nThen, and again. Sing of three hundred men\nSlaughter! Persians!\nGlory and death. Spartans will never surrender\nMorning has broken, today they're fighting in the shade\nWhen arrows blocked the sun they fell,\nTonight they dine in Hell\nBy traitor's hand. secret passage, to their land\nKnow his name, know his shame will last forever\n"
